          <h3>Selection & Initial Impression</h3>
          <p>
            The website “Don’t Board Me” was awarded Site of the Day by Awwwards
            on March 11, 2024, a recognition that highlights its excellent
            design, user experience, and creativity. The site belongs to a home
            pet care company and stands out for its warm aesthetic and friendly
            communication, prioritizing emotional experience over complex
            technical effects. From the very first moment, the site conveys a
            sense of trust and tenderness. The composition is simple yet
            effective: a happy dog image, a clear message, and a clean, charming
            design. It doesn’t aim to impress with excessive animations but
            rather to create an emotional connection with the visitor through
            friendly doodles and illustrations. In addition, the warm color
            palette reinforces the idea of closeness and well-being.
          </p>

          <h3>Structure & Information Architecture</h3>
          <p>
            The information architecture is direct and logical. The menu
            includes sections like “Services,” “Pricing,” “About,” “Blog,” and
            “Contact,” plus a very clear “Book Now” button that stays visible.
            As you scroll, the narrative is smooth and engaging: first it
            explains what the company does in “Services,” and it also uses
            option carousels so you can switch between services. Then comes the
            step-by-step process “How it works”, which guides you on how to
            proceed. Finally, you see the testimonials and pricing.
          </p>

          <h3>Visual Design</h3>
          <p>
            The color palette is soft, featuring shades of red and pink,
            complemented by neutral and natural tones that enhance the pet
            images without being distracting. The typography is modern, legible,
            and consistent throughout the site. The design reinforces the
            identity of a friendly, professional, and empathetic brand. There
            are no overwhelming elements, everything feels airy and harmonious.
            Additionally, the illustrations are very cute and visually engaging.
          </p>

          <h3>Interaction & Microinteractions</h3>
          <p>
            The site doesn’t use 3D effects or WebGL animations, but it does
            include microinteractions and subtle animations: entry transitions,
            scroll movements, hover effects on buttons, and small details like
            the dog’s fur moving slightly. These gentle animations make the
            experience more enjoyable without distracting from the content.
          </p>

          <h3>Usability & Accessibility</h3>
          <p>
            The website is clear and intuitive. Everything is easily accessible:
            information, pricing, booking, and contact. The design prioritizes
            readability, contrast, and clean navigation. It’s also very well
            thought out for the average user, without overwhelming them with
            unnecessary or hard-to-use elements. On mobile devices, the design
            responds correctly, although the size of some images could slightly
            affect loading speed.
          </p>
          <h3>Technical Performance</h3>
          <p>
            As an award-winning site, “Don’t Board Me” meets high standards of
            performance and accessibility. However, since it contains many
            images, loading times can increase if they aren’t fully optimized.
            Navigation is smooth, and resources are well managed. According to
            the Lighthouse report (featured on Awwwards), the site scores highly
            in design, creativity, and UX.
          </p>
          <h3>Excellence Criteria</h3>
          <p>
            The design is outstanding, achieving a perfect balance between clean
            aesthetics and emotional purpose. Usability is excellent, intuitive
            and seamless. Creativity is moderate but effective, focusing more on
            empathy than on technical innovation. The content is substantial and
            well-structured, with concise, user-friendly text.
          </p>
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>
            This site really shows how powerful simplicity can be when it’s
            combined with a strong emotional message. I especially loved the
            overall aesthetics, everything feels warm, balanced, and visually
            inviting. The subtle microinteractions add a nice touch of
            professionalism without making the experience heavy, and the clear
            hierarchy with visible calls to action makes it super easy to
            navigate. Still, it could improve a bit by optimizing images for
            faster loading on mobile, maybe tweaking contrasts.

        <!-- Analysis content for CHIPSA -->
        <div class="analysis-text">
          <h3>Selection & Initial Impression</h3>
          <p>
            Chipsa design immediately establishes itself as a high-level
            creative studio, recognized internationally and awarded by platforms
            such as CSSDA, Behance, Awwwards, and FWA. Its tagline, “We evoke
            emotions through aesthetics, WebGL and 3D,” sets the expectation for
            an immersive, emotionally engaging experience. On first entering the
            site, the impact is striking: high-quality imagery, fluid
            animations, and sophisticated visuals create a sense of modernity
            and professionalism while inviting exploration. The design feels
            immersive rather than overwhelming, making users want to interact
            further.
          </p>

          <h3>Structure & Information Architecture</h3>
          <p>
            The site demonstrates a well-considered information architecture.
            The top menu includes “Cases,” “About Studio,” “Sites,”
            “Interfaces,” “Visuals,” and “Contacts,” providing immediate clarity
            about the studio’s offerings. The content is presented in a
            chaptered structure, with a “Choose Chapter” option on the bottom
            left, that allows users to navigate sections at their own pace. This
            approach organizes the experience logically: first showcasing work,
            then explaining philosophy and services, and finally presenting
            contact information and recognitions.
          </p>

          <h3>Visual Design</h3>
          <p>
            Chipsa design excels visually, balancing soberness and
            sophistication. A subtle color palette allows 3D imagery and CGI
            elements to remain the focus, while modern, clean typography ensures
            readability and complements the overall aesthetic. The use of 3D and
            WebGL is integral to the site’s identity, giving it a unique and
            recognizable style that communicates expertise in digital design
            rather than relying solely on conventional graphics.
          </p>

          <h3>Interaction & Microinteractions</h3>
          <p>
            The site’s interactivity enhances the experience without distracting
            from content. Animations and transitions are smooth and purposeful,
            reacting to cursor movement, scroll, and section changes.
            Microinteractions such as hover effects and subtle element shifts
            create a sense of depth and engagement, making the user feel as if
            they are navigating a tactile space rather than a static page. It
            really makes the user immerse into the webpage.
          </p>

          <h3>Usability & Accessibility</h3>
          <p>
            Despite the complexity of its visuals and 3D content, Chipsa design
            remains intuitive and user-friendly. Navigation is clear, the
            hierarchy is consistent, and users can locate information without
            confusion. On desktop, the experience is fluid, though heavy 3D
            assets may affect performance on less powerful devices or slower
            connections. Overall the site balances visual richness with
            usability.
          </p>
          <h3>Technical Performance</h3>
          <p>
            Technically, the site is ambitious, combining WebGL, CGI, and large
            media assets while maintaining smooth navigation. Such features can
            challenge loading times and metrics, however the design appears
            well-optimized for performance. Responsiveness seems strong,
            adapting across screen sizes, and though accessibility might benefit
            from additional refinements, the technical aspects make it possible
            for a great immersive experience.
          </p>
          <h3>Excellence Criteria</h3>
          <p>
            Chipsa design demonstrates excellence in multiple areas. Its design
            is outstanding, visually striking, cohesive, and memorable.
            Usability is generally strong, with minor potential friction on
            slower devices. Creativity is very high, combining storytelling, 3D,
            and interactive elements in innovative ways. The content is
            substantive, providing case studies, descriptions, and recognition
            that showcase the studio’s expertise and reinforce the narrative
            beyond purely visual appeal.
          </p>
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>
            Overall, Chipsa design is an exemplar of immersive, narrative-driven
            web design. It illustrates how emotion, interactivity, and clarity
            can coexist to create a memorable user experience. Key takeaways
            include the importance of structured navigation, smooth
            microinteractions, and a cohesive visual identity, while maintaining
            performance and accessibility. The site serves as a benchmark for
            how high-quality design, storytelling, and technical expertise can
            work together to elevate a digital portfolio.
