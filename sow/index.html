    <h3>Selection & Initial Impression</h3>
    <p>
     The website “Don’t Board Me” was awarded Site of the Day by Awwwards on March 11, 2024, a recognition that highlights its excellent design, user experience, and creativity. The site belongs to a home pet care company and stands out for its warm aesthetic and friendly communication, prioritizing emotional experience over complex technical effects. From the very first moment, the site conveys a sense of trust and tenderness. The composition is simple yet effective: a happy dog image, a clear message, and a clean, charming design. It doesn’t aim to impress with excessive animations but rather to create an emotional connection with the visitor through friendly doodles and illustrations. In addition, the warm color palette reinforces the idea of closeness and well-being.
    </p>

    <h3>Structure & Information Architecture</h3>
    <p>
    The information architecture is direct and logical. The menu includes sections like “Services,” “Pricing,” “About,” “Blog,” and “Contact,” plus a very clear “Book Now” button that stays visible. As you scroll, the narrative is smooth and engaging: first it explains what the company does in “Services,” and it also uses option carousels so you can switch between services. Then comes the step-by-step process “How it works”, which guides you on how to proceed. Finally, you see the testimonials and pricing.
    </p>

    <h3>Visual Design</h3>
    <p>
     The color palette is soft, featuring shades of red and pink, complemented by neutral and natural tones that enhance the pet images without being distracting. The typography is modern, legible, and consistent throughout the site. The design reinforces the identity of a friendly, professional, and empathetic brand. There are no overwhelming elements, everything feels airy and harmonious. Additionally, the illustrations are very cute and visually engaging.
    </p>

    <h3>Interaction & Microinteractions</h3>
    <p>
      The site features smooth hover effects on project cards, revealing
      additional information on interaction. Scroll-triggered animations add
      dynamism without overwhelming the user. Filter and sorting options provide
      excellent control over content discovery.
    </p>

    <h3>Usability & Accessibility</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Clarity:</strong> Information is well-organized with clear
      calls-to-action. Project details are easy to access.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Accessibility:</strong> While visually impressive, some contrast
      ratios could be improved for better readability. Keyboard navigation is
      generally well-implemented.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Loading:</strong> Initial load is reasonably fast, though heavy
      use of images requires optimization.
    </p>

    <h3>Technical Performance</h3>
    <p>
      The site demonstrates solid technical implementation with lazy loading for
      images and efficient resource management. However, the abundance of visual
      content can impact Core Web Vitals, particularly on slower connections.
      The semantic HTML structure supports SEO and accessibility.
    </p>

    <h3>Excellence Criteria</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Creativity:</strong> The design successfully balances creativity
        with functionality, serving as both a showcase and a functional
        directory.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Content:</strong> Rich, curated content with detailed project
        descriptions and credits.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>UX:</strong> User experience is generally excellent, with
        intuitive navigation and discovery features.
      </li>
    </ul>

            <p class="conclusion">
              **Conclusion:** The site stands out for its creative animations,
              but it could improve loading to optimize performance on mobile.
